This particular app increments or decrements using a stepper. This implementation is simple, but shows the true power behind Redux and its control over global state. 

## Installation

1. Clone this github respository. 
2. Then from your command line run these in order: 


```bash
cd React-Redux-ButtonFlow
```

```bash
npm i -- save react-redux
```


```bash
cd client
```
 
```bash
npm start
```

This is a basic front-end application that will automatically run on localport:3000 on your web-browser.
Enjoy! Feel free to play around with it.
